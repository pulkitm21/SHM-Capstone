# Capstone
A React-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) dashboard for seismic monitoring of wind turbines.

This system visualizes real-time vibration, acceleration, and tilt data from MEMS sensor nodes installed on a wind turbine structure

# Overview

- Frontend: React (dashboard UI)
- Backend: Node.js / FastAPI (sensor gateway + database)
- Transport: REST + WebSockets
- Database: PostgreSQL
